# Work with Data in a Microsoft Fabric Eventhouse

This repository provides a guide on how to create and work with an Eventhouse in Microsoft Fabric, demonstrating how to populate it with sample data and query that data using both Kusto Query Language (KQL) and Transact-SQL (T-SQL).

## Introduction

In Microsoft Fabric, an **eventhouse** is used to store real-time data related to events, often captured from a streaming data source by an **eventstream**. Within an eventhouse, data is stored in one or more KQL databases, which contain tables and other objects that can be queried using KQL or a subset of SQL.

This exercise will guide you through creating and populating an eventhouse with sample taxi ride data, and then querying it using KQL and T-SQL.

**Approximate Lab Duration:** 25 minutes

## Prerequisites

* A [Microsoft Fabric tenant](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=fabric) is required to complete this exercise.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to explore data querying capabilities within a Microsoft Fabric Eventhouse.

### 1. Create a Workspace

Before working with data in Fabric, you need to create a workspace with Fabric capacity enabled.

1.  Navigate to the [Microsoft Fabric home page](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=fabric) in a browser and sign in with your Fabric credentials.
2.  In the menu bar on the left, select **Workspaces** (the icon looks similar to üóá).
3.  Create a new workspace with a name of your choice, selecting a licensing mode that includes Fabric capacity (**Trial**, **Premium**, or **Fabric**).

    *When your new workspace opens, it should be empty.*

### 2. Create an Eventhouse

Now that you have a workspace with support for Fabric capacity, you can create an Eventhouse within it.

1.  In the menu bar on the left, select **Workloads**. Then, select the **Real-Time Intelligence** tile.


2.  On the **Real-Time Intelligence** home page, select the **Explore Real-Time Intelligence Sample** tile. This will automatically create an eventhouse called `RTISample`.


    *In the pane on the left, note that your eventhouse contains a KQL database with the same name as the eventhouse.*
    *Verify that a `Bikestream` table has also been created within the KQL database.*

### 3. Query Data by using KQL

Kusto Query Language (KQL) is an intuitive, comprehensive language you can use to query a KQL database.

#### Retrieve data from a table with KQL

1.  In the left pane of the eventhouse window, under your KQL database, select the default `queryset` file. This file contains some sample KQL queries to get you started.


2.  Modify the first example query as follows:

    ```kusto
    Bikestream
    | take 100
    ```
    *NOTE: The Pipe (`|`) character is used for two purposes in KQL including to separate query operators in a tabular expression statement. It is also used as a logical OR operator within square or round brackets to denote that you may specify one of the items separated by the pipe character.*

3.  Select the query code and run it to return 100 rows from the table.

    You can be more precise by adding specific attributes you want to query using the `project` keyword and then using the `take` keyword to tell the engine how many records to return.

4.  Type, select, and run the following query:

    ```kusto
    // Use 'project' and 'take' to view a sample number of records in the table and check the data.
    Bikestream
    | project Street, No_Bikes
    | take 10
    ```
    *NOTE: The use of `//` denotes a comment.*

    Another common practice in analysis is renaming columns in our queryset to make them more user-friendly.

5.  Try the following query:

    ```kusto
    Bikestream
    | project Street, ["Number of Empty Docks"] = No_Empty_Docks
    | take 10
    ```

#### Summarize data by using KQL

You can use the `summarize` keyword with a function to aggregate and otherwise manipulate data.

1.  Try the following query, which uses the `sum` function to summarize the rental data to see how many bikes are available in total:

    ```kusto
    Bikestream
    | summarize ["Total Number of Bikes"] = sum(No_Bikes)
    ```
    You can group the summarized data by a specified column or expression.

2.  Run the following query to group the number of bikes by neighbourhood to determine the amount of available bikes in each neighbourhood:

    ```kusto
    Bikestream
    | summarize ["Total Number of Bikes"] = sum(No_Bikes) by Neighbourhood
    | project Neighbourhood, ["Total Number of Bikes"]
    ```
    If any of the bike points has a null or empty entry for neighbourhood, the results of summarization will include a blank value, which is never good for analysis.

3.  Modify the query as shown here to use the `case` function along with the `isempty` and `isnull` functions to group all trips for which the neighbourhood is unknown into an `Unidentified` category for follow-up.

    ```kusto
    Bikestream
    | summarize ["Total Number of Bikes"] = sum(No_Bikes) by Neighbourhood
    | project Neighbourhood = case(isempty(Neighbourhood) or isnull(Neighbourhood), "Unidentified", Neighbourhood), ["Total Number of Bikes"]
    ```
    *Note: As this sample dataset is well-maintained, you might not have an Unidentified field in the query result.*

#### Sort data by using KQL

To make more sense of our data, we typically order it by a column, and this process is done in KQL with either a `sort by` or `order by` operator (they act the same way).

1.  Try the following query:

    ```kusto
    Bikestream
    | summarize ["Total Number of Bikes"] = sum(No_Bikes) by Neighbourhood
    | project Neighbourhood = case(isempty(Neighbourhood) or isnull(Neighbourhood), "Unidentified", Neighbourhood), ["Total Number of Bikes"]
    | sort by Neighbourhood asc
    ```
2.  Modify the query as follows and run it again, and note that the `order by` operator works the same way as `sort by`:

    ```kusto
    Bikestream
    | summarize ["Total Number of Bikes"] = sum(No_Bikes) by Neighbourhood
    | project Neighbourhood = case(isempty(Neighbourhood) or isnull(Neighbourhood), "Unidentified", Neighbourhood), ["Total Number of Bikes"]
    | order by Neighbourhood asc
    ```

#### Filter data by using KQL

In KQL, the `where` clause is used to filter data. You can combine conditions in a `where` clause by using `and` and `or` logical operators.

1.  Run the following query to filter the bike data to include only bike points in the Chelsea neighbourhood:

    ```kusto
    Bikestream
    | where Neighbourhood == "Chelsea"
    | summarize ["Total Number of Bikes"] = sum(No_Bikes) by Neighbourhood
    | project Neighbourhood = case(isempty(Neighbourhood) or isnull(Neighbourhood), "Unidentified", Neighbourhood), ["Total Number of Bikes"]
    | sort by Neighbourhood asc
    ```

### 4. Query Data by using Transact-SQL

KQL Database doesn‚Äôt support Transact-SQL natively, but it provides a T-SQL endpoint that emulates Microsoft SQL Server and allows you to run T-SQL queries on your data. The T-SQL endpoint has some limitations and differences from the native SQL Server. For example, it doesn‚Äôt support creating, altering, or dropping tables, or inserting, updating, or deleting data. It also doesn‚Äôt support some T-SQL functions and syntax that aren‚Äôt compatible with KQL. It was created to allow systems that didn‚Äôt support KQL to use T-SQL to query the data within a KQL Database. So, it‚Äôs recommended to use KQL as the primary query language for KQL Database, as it offers more capabilities and performance than T-SQL. You can also use some SQL functions that are supported by KQL, such as `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, and so on.

#### Retrieve data from a table by using Transact-SQL

1.  In your queryset, add and run the following Transact-SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT TOP 100 * from Bikestream
    ```
2.  Modify the query as follows to retrieve specific columns:

    ```sql
    SELECT TOP 10 Street, No_Bikes
    FROM Bikestream
    ```
3.  Modify the query to assign an alias that renames `No_Empty_Docks` to a more user-friendly name:

    ```sql
    SELECT TOP 10 Street, No_Empty_Docks as [Number of Empty Docks]
    from Bikestream
    ```

#### Summarize data by using Transact-SQL

1.  Run the following query to find the total number of bikes available:

    ```sql
    SELECT sum(No_Bikes) AS [Total Number of Bikes]
    FROM Bikestream
    ```
2.  Modify the query to group the total number of bikes by neighbourhood:

    ```sql
    SELECT Neighbourhood, Sum(No_Bikes) AS [Total Number of Bikes]
    FROM Bikestream
    GROUP BY Neighbourhood
    ```
3.  Modify the query further to use a `CASE` statement to group bike points with an unknown origin into an `Unidentified` category for follow-up.

    ```sql
    SELECT CASE
              WHEN Neighbourhood IS NULL OR Neighbourhood = '' THEN 'Unidentified'
              ELSE Neighbourhood
            END AS Neighbourhood,
            SUM(No_Bikes) AS [Total Number of Bikes]
    FROM Bikestream
    GROUP BY CASE
                WHEN Neighbourhood IS NULL OR Neighbourhood = '' THEN 'Unidentified'
                ELSE Neighbourhood
              END;
    ```

#### Sort data by using Transact-SQL

1.  Run the following query to order the grouped results by neighbourhood:

    ```sql
    SELECT CASE
              WHEN Neighbourhood IS NULL OR Neighbourhood = '' THEN 'Unidentified'
              ELSE Neighbourhood
            END AS Neighbourhood,
            SUM(No_Bikes) AS [Total Number of Bikes]
    FROM Bikestream
    GROUP BY CASE
                WHEN Neighbourhood IS NULL OR Neighbourhood = '' THEN 'Unidentified'
                ELSE Neighbourhood
              END
    ORDER BY Neighbourhood ASC;
    ```

#### Filter data by using Transact-SQL

1.  Run the following query to filter the grouped data so that only rows having a neighbourhood of ‚ÄúChelsea‚Äù are included in the results:

    ```sql
    SELECT CASE
              WHEN Neighbourhood IS NULL OR Neighbourhood = '' THEN 'Unidentified'
              ELSE Neighbourhood
            END AS Neighbourhood,
            SUM(No_Bikes) AS [Total Number of Bikes]
    FROM Bikestream
    GROUP BY CASE
                WHEN Neighbourhood IS NULL OR Neighbourhood = '' THEN 'Unidentified'
                ELSE Neighbourhood
              END
    HAVING Neighbourhood = 'Chelsea'
    ORDER BY Neighbourhood ASC;
    ```
